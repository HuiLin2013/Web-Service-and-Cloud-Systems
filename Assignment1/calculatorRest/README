To use the clients made by Mikolaj to test both the stateless
and the stateful Calculator web services, you have to run
CalculatorRestStartUp. This program makes sure that that the
stateless Calculator web service is served on:

http://localhost:9999/calcrest/calc

and the stateful Calculator web service is served on:

http://localhost:9999/calcrest/calc2

Note: both Calculator web services only support Reversed
Polish Notation (RPN)
