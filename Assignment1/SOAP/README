To use the included CalculatorClient, you need to run the
CalculatorPublisher, which publishes the WSDL file locally
on the following URL: http://localhost:8080/WS/Calculator?wsdl
The CalculatorClient will simply show that the Calculator web
service works by printing some simple calculations.

You can also deploy the included WAR file on a Tomcat installation
(assuming you have the correct JAX-WS dependencies for Tomcat
installed). If you have copied the file into the webapps directory
of Tomcat, you will find the WSDL file on the following URL:
http://localhost:8080/CalculatorSOAP/calculator?wsdl
